The application follows a client-server architecture. The React frontend allows users to upload an image via file or URL. The image is converted to base64 and sent to the Express backend. The backend generates an embedding using OpenAI’s embedding API. Each product in the database has a precomputed embedding stored in JSON. Cosine similarity is calculated between the uploaded image embedding and each product embedding. Results are sorted by similarity score and returned to the frontend.

The frontend displays the uploaded image, similarity results, and includes a slider filter to dynamically filter products by similarity threshold. Loading states and error handling improve user experience. The system is modular, separating concerns into utilities (OpenAI integration, similarity), routes, and components. The application is deployment-ready for Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend), with environment variables for API configuration.
